This code is intended to run on an Arduino Uno in a backpack connected to an 
Adafruit PN532 RFID shield and a FONA 808 Breakout, but there's no guarantee 
it will work for your device.

The intended function is to report GPS location and RFID assets to a Phant 
server over a GSM connection.

Most of this code was copied from Adafruit repositories and other IoT 
projects, and is not finished or actively maintained.

Unfinished code is marked with !! in comments
