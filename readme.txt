This code is intended to run on an Arduino Uno connected to an 
Adafruit PN532 RFID shield and a FONA 808 Breakout, but there's
no guarantee it will work for your device.

The intended function is to report GPS location and RFID assets
to a Phant server over a GSM connection.

Most of this code was copied from Adafruit repositories and
other IoT projects, and is not finished or actively maintained.

Unfinished code is marked with !! in comments
